Chesspresso
This website is to promote a fictional coffee shop, located in Dublin city centre.
The site will be specifically targeted towards individuals who enjoy coffee or chess. The website will seek to encourage people to attend the coffee shop through our menu and selection of hot beverages. The coffee shop will have a fictional address in Dublin city centre on Drury Street, and primarily be a place to relax, with weekly social chess meet ups.

Features
Navigation Bar
-	Feature on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery, and Register page. The navigation bar is identical on all three pages to allow for ease of navigation for the user.
-	The section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices be they using a smart phone or laptop with a monitor.

Find Us

Footer
-	The footer sections include links to the relevant social media sites. The hyperlinks open in new pages.
-	The footer is a useful addition to the user, and it encourages users to keep connected via our social media. Via the social media, enticing images of the vibrant community would be posted to retain their interest in Chesspresso.

Home Page
Landing page Image
-	This section introduces the user to the Chesspresso with a wholesome image of two men enjoying playing chess, including a gentle but eye-catching animation, designed to grab the user's attention.

Gallery Page
This page aims to help the user understand what to expect from attending the shop. There are appealing images of coffees beside chessboards, happy looking baristas, and individuals of various ages playing chess so that the website feels inclusive to users of all ages and backgrounds.

Register
Submission form
-	On the register page we find a submission form, for users to use their name and email to sign up to the Chesspresso newsletter which tells the users about upcoming events and meet-ups.

While this is a html/ css project and therefore not connected to a backend server, the form is validated in several ways:
1. users cannot submit until a value is in all three fields
2. the form cannot be submitted unless an email containing an @ symbol is included
3. a button turns green on hover, and CSS animation appears on click, to notify the user was successfully clicked
4. a javascript 'Form Submitted!' message appears informing the user their details have been successfully received.

Register Page Pictures
-	A further small set of four images suggests to users that this is also a relaxing place to sit and enjoy a drink or food, a reminder to the user that this is a coffee shop for everyone and not just chess fanatics.

Embedded video
-	On the register page, a video of the chess youtube and twitch star Anna Cramling playing Mike from Coffee Chess LA, provides some human interest, and entices the user with a typical and fun example of how informal chess is played.

UX Design Comments

A white background will be used for the website to contrast with the dark grey font, and black font. This will give the website a classic feel, with the white background and dark grey/ black contrasting appropriately for the user's ease. The white and dark contrast will also subconsciously suggest the themes of a classic chessboard.
Please see the wireframe for the mobile design of the landing page in the assets folder. As a coffee shop website, a user will find all essential information on the landing page, for those interested in viewing pictures of the chess community or registering to be involved, they can easily navigate to these two pages.

A user who searches for the website will be viewing the website to find information about the whereabouts of the coffee shop, and potentially what to expect there. Therefore, the address and contact details of the coffee shop will be clearly available on the bottom of each of the three pages. Visual imagery of people enjoying a game of chess with hot drinks beside them, will help create the appeal that this is a fun, relaxed and welcoming environment. Another reason a user may check the website is the menu. Therefore, on the landing page, scrolling down the menu will be available for people to check what food and drink is available. 

A 'Why Visit Us' section on the landing page will also provide four core reasons why someone may wish to attend the coffee shop. For any user who actively searched out the website, or stumbled across it, they will confirm why it would be beneficial to attend. An appealing image of a latte with coffee art and a classic wooden chess board behind the coffee will entice the user and summarise two key themes of the site. The index page will be responsive on a variety of device from small smart phone to computers with large displays, to allow the website to be pleasant for the user to interact with. Please see the below ipad view of the 'Why Visit Us' section.

For those interested in becoming part of the Chesspresso commumity, they will navigate to the register page. This is clearly labelled at the top of every page in the navigation bar, and on the register page the form is placed prominently near the top.
