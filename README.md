Register
Submission form
-	On the register page we find a submission form, for users to use their name and email to sign up to the Chesspresso newsletter which tells the users about upcoming events and meet-ups.

While this is a html/ css project and therefore not connected to a backend server, the form is validated in several ways:
1. users cannot submit until a value is in all three fields;
2. the form cannot be submitted unless an email containing an @ symbol is included;
3. a button turns green on hover, and CSS animation appears on click, to notify the user was successfully clicked;
4. a javascript 'Form Submitted!' message appears informing the user there details have been successfully considered.

Pictures
-	A further small set of four images suggests to users that this is also a relaxing place to sit and enjoy a drink or food, a reminder to the user that this is a coffee shop for everyone and not just chess fanatics.

Embedded video
-	On the register page, a video of the chess youtube and twich star Anna Cramling playing Mike from Coffee Chess LA, provides some human interest, and entices the user with a typical and fun example of how informal chess is played.

UX Design Comments

A white background will be used for the website to contrast with the dark grey font, and black font. This will give the website a classic feel, with the white background and dark grey/ black contrasting appropriately for the user's ease. The white and dark will also subconsciously suggest the themes of a classic chessboard.
Please see the attached wireframe within the assets folder for the mobile design of the landing page.

A user who searches for the website will be viewing the website to find information about the whereabouts of the coffee shop, and what happens there. Therefore the address and contact details of the coffee shop will be clearly available on the bottom of each of the three pages. Visual imagery of people enjoying a game of chess with hot drinks beside them, will help create the appeal that this is an fun, relaxed and welcoming environment. On the landing page, scrolling down the menu will be available for people to check what food and drink is available. 

A "Why Visit Us" section on the landing page will also provide four core reasons why someone may wish to attend the coffee shop. For any user who actively searched out the website, or stumbled across it, they will confirm why it would be beneficial to attend. An appealing image of a latte with coffee art and a classic wooden chess board behind the coffee will entice the user and summarise two key themes of the site.

For those interested in becoming part of the Chesspresso commumity, they will navigate to the register page. This is clearly labelled at the top of every page in the navigation bar, and on the register page the form is placed prominently near the top.
